# OptikeyIPA
A fork of Optikey which adds IPA support for sounding out words

This is based on [Optikey Coder](https://github.com/kmcnaught/OptikeyCoder) which is itself based on [OptiKey](https://github.com/OptiKey/OptiKey).

It currently supports: 
1. Typing single words with a phonemic keyboard, for example in the context of a Speech and Language Therapy session, or in order to communicate a word that you don't have access to on your AAC device and are not managing to spell.
2. Deploying multiple choice quizzes based on the phonemes, for example to support an SLT target
3. Deploying IPA "spelling" tests to practice sounding out complete words, and giving feedback on how your spelling attempt differed from the correct IPA.
